# Scheduled sender: independent lifecycle review

FT049r27; read-only review of root helper candidate on2026-09-12. No peer edits,
workload rerun, sender execution or production runtime change was performed.

The parent pre-serializes exact request frames, flushes its buffered stdin handle,
and passes the descriptor exclusively to one child during the burst. Base64 config
transport preserves bytes. The child uses at-most-PIPE_BUF writes after writable
select, preserving shared descriptor flags and frame order under the sole-writer
assumption. Parent finish reaps the child before retry/configuration writes. Actual
send timestamps remain required; a200ms startup lead does not guarantee cadence.

Two concrete error paths were sent to the helper owner before publication:

1. Sender `finish()` runs only after all ACKs/final preview. A failed sender can thus
   be masked by a later receiver timeout. Check child failure before/after bounded
   reads and preserve the sender's error evidence on that failure path.
2. Sequential `sender.stop(); client.stop()` in `finally` skips helper cleanup if
   sender stop raises. Nest cleanup with `finally` so helper stop and event-file
   close remain attempted independently.

The owner reported five lifecycle tests passing; this reviewer inspected their
coverage, did not independently execute them, and does not claim broader coverage.
Explicit cancellation/reaping differs from abrupt parent death: no parent-death
signal was present. A finite child deadline limits continued sending in that case,
but does not prove immediate parent-death termination or an elapsed-time guarantee.

This document records the reviewed candidate and requested changes. It does not
assert that later owner fixes have been reviewed or authorize a throughput run.
