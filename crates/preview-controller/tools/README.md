# Bounded compiler protocol probe

`bounded_protocol_probe.py` compares every complete JSON response with recorded
expected output while measuring request-write through complete-response latency.
Unlike the historical text-scaling capture script, partial stdout and blocked stdin
share one deadline. Oversized replies fail before unbounded accumulation; failure
terminates and reaps only the child this probe started. Stderr goes to a file rather
than an undrained pipe. This is a local single-reply-per-request compiler probe,
not a producer sibling-frame or native rendering harness.

Required options: `--binary`, `--requests`, `--expected`, `--output`.
Optional: `--timeout` seconds (default30), `--max-reply` bytes (default16MiB).
The output directory must be new; existing directories are refused to prevent stale
success artifacts from a prior run. Nonfinite or nonpositive timeouts are rejected. Complete captured replies, bounded failed-response prefixes
and stderr remain on failure; result.json is written only after successful checks.
Historical benchmark files/results are unchanged and used their archived script.

Validation: four real-child tests cover a partial response stall, a worker that
never reads its request, oversized partial output, and two valid replies. Every
case verifies child termination. Two additional tests check reused-directory and
invalid-timeout refusal before worker startup. The actual optimized Text compiler also passes
all ten recorded text-session request/response comparisons through this probe.

Run: `python3 -m unittest discover -s crates/preview-controller/tools -p test_bounded_protocol_probe.py -v`.

Before success the probe closes stdin and requires stdout EOF within the deadline;
any trailing output is refused. Request IDs are checked when present; compile
results additionally match project and revision. Error replies remain errors with
matching IDs. Two additional tests cover trailing output and a wrong reference ID.
Cleanup reaps the direct child; it does not claim process-tree supervision.

Large-frame scanning update: exchange now searches only the newly read chunk for
newline. Earlier chunks contain no newline because that would already have ended
or refused the exchange. This avoids rescanning the accumulated frame on every
read (quadratic work for fragmented large replies). Existing bounds, exact final
newline framing, failure prefixes, deadlines and identity checks remain unchanged.
Ten real-child tests now include a large fragmented reply with separately written
newline, and refusal of a newline followed by trailing bytes in a later chunk.

scan-observation.json records five alternating old/new isolated measurements for
8MiB received in8KiB chunks: accumulation+scan median121.44ms→0.50ms. This is NOT
compiler or native latency. Historical benchmark timings are unchanged; do not
retroactively subtract this synthetic overhead from them. Reproduce by accumulating
1024 chunks (last byte newline) into a bytearray; compare searching the growing
array each iteration against chunk.find, using perf_counter and retaining both
raw sample sets. First allocation/caching effects are visible in the samples.
