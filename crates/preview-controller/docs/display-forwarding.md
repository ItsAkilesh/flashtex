# Opt-in helper display-list forwarding (FT-048r6 / FT-049r1)

Status: helper implementation checkpoint using runtime f58b656. Default OFF.
Runtime owner: FT-049. Helper owner: FT-048. Native acceptance remains separate.

The producer contract is runtime-v1 `display-list-v2`: an accepted, nonfailed
compile result is immediately followed by exactly one matching `display_list`
JSON line. A declined capability yields ordinary v1 output only. Unsupported
producers remain usable. The runtime validates request/project/revision and exact
source byte lengths and SHA256 bindings, while downstream rendering validation
must check fonts, resources, operations and features. A candidate is untrusted.

## Negotiation and lifetime

Helper command `configure_display_candidates` requires
`capability:"display-candidates-v1"`, `enabled:boolean`, and explicit
`renderer_support_confirmed:true` when enabling. Default is OFF. The client waits
for its result before expecting any candidate. Enabling must also enroll the
producer layout capability through the existing controller negotiation, preserving
other requested layout capabilities. Historical completed-snapshot retention and
display candidates are initially mutually exclusive; reject conflicting enable
requests without changing either policy.

Disable, restart, close, layout changes and source/membership changes invalidate
pending candidates. Enabling cannot resurrect work submitted before that enable
operation. Runtime acceptance of a sibling remains bounded by the existing active
request timeout: a promised but missing sibling must not stall forever.

## Delivery

Keep required v1 preview/ACK/error FIFO behavior. Before taking a runtime candidate,
check the existing optional output slot's admission condition. This allows the
runtime's single candidate slot to retain the candidate while the v1 fallback
frame finishes writing, without adding a second helper pending-value slot.

Move the candidate envelope into a helper `update` with a payload:

- `kind:"display_candidate"`, `untrusted:true`, `source_actions_enabled:false`;
- original `request_id`, `project_id`, `compile_revision`;
- exact controller `source_versions` and `membership_generation`; source hash
  bindings remain inside the original v2 envelope;
- `display_list`: the original v2 envelope, moved without a full-value clone.

The outer helper envelope retains its existing `session_id`. Recheck the current
controller generation and source snapshot before admission. Serialize under the
complete helper frame limit. An oversized optional candidate is dropped; required
replies continue intact. Admission races may also drop candidates. Do not transform
these drops into successful v2 delivery claims.

Both optional features share the existing one-frame output slot, with mutually
exclusive opt-ins initially. Required output clears any queued optional frame.
An optional write already started cannot be preempted; retain the existing stalled
writer watchdog. No hard end-to-end latency claim follows from queue boundedness.

## Native gate

The client accepts only its current helper session/request/source identity and
requested format. Validate the entire v2 display envelope and font assets off the
UI thread, then recheck source/session identity immediately before paint. Candidate
receipt alone never authorizes source navigation or establishes pixel parity.
Retain the v1 fallback when optional frames are absent, invalid or dropped.

Implementation gates: default/declined producer compatibility, exact sibling
correlation and timeout, stale/toggled-session refusal, source hash validation,
required-output priority, bounded oversized-frame handling, restart/close cleanup,
and a real native helper-route measurement. Existing direct-Mac producer results
do not prove this helper route works.

The configuration result includes `enabled` and a separate `preview_error` if the
policy was accepted but its fresh compile could not be submitted. A failed
configuration precondition does not change either optional mode. Disable removes
the layout capability and requests a fresh v1 compile. Restart requires a fresh
opt-in. Layout configuration cannot request display-list-v2 while the mode is OFF.

`take_current_display_payload` checks the runtime candidate against current
controller request ID, compile generation, submitted membership/version snapshot,
source hashes and byte lengths. The envelope's document revision is a compiler
generation per the sibling contract; the outer `source_versions` map carries
individual durable document revisions. They must not be equated.

Initial actual-helper fixture verifies matching v1-before-candidate delivery,
individual source revisions, explicit confirmation, mutually exclusive policies,
and restart reset. Its payload intentionally lacks renderer-valid resources: this
is transport evidence, not rendering evidence. Remaining native and malformed/
backpressure integration gates above must be completed before release activation.

Additional helper subprocess checks pause the fixture between its v1 result and
sibling using a filesystem release signal, persist a newer edit before release,
and verify only the newer source hash/version reaches optional output. A corrupt
sibling hash triggers preview failure without exposing a candidate; a subsequent
edit still persists and survives helper kill/reopen. These checks exercise the real
helper/runtime boundary with a transport fixture, not a real renderer.

Both optional routes use the same complete-frame serializer/admission boundary.
Its tests include compact JSON numbers that expand on reserialization: exceeding
the output budget publishes no partial optional bytes and leaves the following
required ACK intact. Exact newline-inclusive limits and obsolete epochs are also
checked. These are boundary tests, not a full-sized native output stress test.

With existing `diagnostic_timings:true`, stderr includes `phase:optional_output`,
`kind`, `outcome` (`admitted`, `busy_or_obsolete`, or `serialization_refused`) and
`serialization_ms`. These diagnostics contain no source text or payload data.
Admission is queue acceptance, not proof of native receipt or paint. As with other
phase diagnostics, clients must drain stderr while enabled.

Full-size helper failure-path tests now cover a roughly 5.6 MB numeric sibling that
fits the runtime's default input bound but expands beyond the real 16 MiB helper
output bound. The test waits for explicit `serialization_refused` diagnostics,
then verifies an intact edit ACK and exact durable reopen. Another test keeps
stdout open but unread after startup, admits a 1 MiB optional display frame, and
verifies the existing stalled-writer watchdog terminates the helper while source
remains intact. These use transport fixtures and do not establish native paint
performance or renderer validity.

Timing interpretation: `compiler_poll` diagnostics include every eventful owner
poll and eventless polls lasting at least 1 ms. Candidate-only processing or
stale-value destruction can occur without a v1 event; older eventful-only traces
must not be summed as complete owner CPU/wall time. Ordinary fast idle polls stay
unlogged. Poll duration includes scheduling and owner work, not just source hashing,
and does not include all background decoder CPU. Fine-grained candidate timing is
owned by the runtime and remains separate from native renderer timing.

With `diagnostic_timings:true`, helper stderr now emits `phase:display_transport`
and the runtime's source-bound scalar `profile`, once per request/revision/display
epoch. No repeated idle-poll measurements are emitted. A cleared runtime profile
resets deduplication. Profile fields are request/project/revision/epoch, framed byte
count, JSON parse time, decoder queue wait, owner delivery wait and source-binding
validation time. They contain no document text or renderer resources. They remain
transport measurements; native font/render validation and paint are not included.

The actual oversized-frame helper test verifies exactly one logged profile after
idle and document-query polls, framed bytes above5MB, and finite nonnegative stage
durations before confirming that durable editing still works. Use these stages
alongside optional-output serialization and end-to-end receipt timings; do not
infer a full latency budget by summing phases from different requests or processes.


Preparatory raw-body serializer boundary: optional admission accepts any typed
`Serialize` value, so a future reviewed candidate wrapper can retain `RawValue`
without first converting it back to `Value`. Current production callers still
supply the original `Value` envelopes; no raw transport mode is activated by this
change. A >8KiB raw-body test preserves exponent and Unicode-escape spelling,
refuses a one-byte-over-budget frame after buffer flushing, confirms no optional
bytes were admitted, then delivers a required ACK and an exact-limit frame.
Source validation and duplicate/numeric/depth acceptance belong to the separate
runtime contract and are not established by this serializer test.


### Experimental raw helper contract (explicit opt-in only)

Startup configuration `display_transport:"raw-prototype"` selects the fixed
runtime decoder strategy before the first compiler session. Omitting it retains
the existing Value strategy. Runtime restarts must preserve the selected strategy
but reset candidate enablement; no already queued frame changes decoder strategy.
The helper must reject unknown selectors before source import or compiler spawn.

Enable via the existing `configure_display_candidates` request with the separate
capability `display-candidates-raw-v1`, `enabled:true` and
`renderer_support_confirmed:true`. Wait for an exact capability acknowledgement.
Value-mode helpers must reject the raw capability and vice versa, without changing
current source or optional epochs. Historical delivery remains mutually exclusive.
The wire candidate shape remains the same; the nested display envelope preserves
original JSON value spelling, excluding transport newline/outer whitespace.

The existing replay harness now accepts `--display-transport raw-prototype` and
requires exact acknowledgement; this fails against older Value-only
helpers instead of silently measuring the wrong route. It also verifies the
candidate request and compile generation match the already received current v1.
Raw provenance records the startup selector and capability. Syntax/help checks
pass. Helper raw integration now passes transport-fixture lifecycle, stale-source,
corrupt-hash and durable-reopen checks. An actual producer raw replay and native
acceptance have not yet run.

Before native activation, require runtime proof of complete syntax/finite numbers/depth,
duplicate identity/source rejection, exact source binding, cancellation and epoch
fences. Native/core validation must reject ambiguous duplicate geometry fields.
Raw `1e9` remains `1e9`; it does not inherit Value's reserialization expansion.
Therefore raw optional overflow tests must use the actual whole output byte size,
while the existing numeric expansion refusal gate remains on the Value route.
Required v1/durable replies, complete-frame limits and explicit native paint
acceptance remain mandatory in either route.


Implementation consumes runtime `217ec7df` unchanged. `RawDisplayPayload` owns the
runtime's immutable raw body and carries controller-checked current source versions
and membership generation. Typed wrapper serialization never converts it back to
Value. Both modes retain the same checked optional queue; default Value callers
and required replies remain unchanged. Unknown/malformed startup selectors fail
before source import. The startup strategy cannot be changed after a compiler
session or request exists. Restart preserves strategy and disables candidates.

The prototype is not a speed recommendation: the initial runtime experiment used
less peak memory but took longer to parse because it repeated validation passes.
Further runtime optimization and complete helper/native measurements remain open.
