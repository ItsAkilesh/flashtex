/// - `holdUntilPreview` (default): the in-flight edit is released only when
///   the preview compiled from its durable revision arrived. Every submitted
///   edit is painted; intermediate keystrokes coalesce into the next edit.
/// - `hybrid` (`FLASHTEX_CONTROLLER_RELEASE=hybrid`): same hold, but once the
///   in-flight edit is durable and has been in flight longer than a bound the
///   newest buffer is sent anyway, so a slow compile does not starve the
///   ledger of fresh durable text. The bound adapts to the last observed
///   edit → preview latency: `2 × last`, clamped to 40…250 ms (`ReleaseBound`).
///   A released edit's compile may then be superseded by the helper (its
///   preview never arrives, or arrives as a labelled historical frame when
///   `completed-snapshots-v1` is negotiated).
